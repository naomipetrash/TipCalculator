Submitted by: **Naomi Petrash**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Custom font
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added an app icon
- [X] Did not remove size classes; wanted it to work on multiple devices
- [X] Added a background color and message to my launch screen
- [X] Added a background color to my view controller
- [X] Rounded the corners of the tip and total labels to match the bill text field
- [X] Changed the status bar to white to match view colors
- [X] Changed the navigation bar background color and nav bar text title, font, color, and size
- [X] Changed the font and font size on segmented control. Changed color when selected
- [X] Changed the background color depending on the selected tip amount and modified nav bar color to be similar to the newly changed color
